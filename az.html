<h1> Two Datasets for Argumentative Zoning of Scientific Documents </h1>

<p> The <a href="https://yg244.github.io/abstract_az_annotation.zip">AZ abstract corpus</a> contains 1k PubMed abstracts from years 1998 to 2008 from journals representing different areas of biomedicine (e.g. molecular biology, epidemiology, toxicology, etc.). Each sentence in the abstracts has been annotated with one of the following labels: Background, Objective, Method, Result, Conclusion, Related work, and Future work, supporting the task of argumentative zoning (AZ). The corpus is distributed in both html and txt files. If you use the corpus in published work, please cite the following paper:</p>
